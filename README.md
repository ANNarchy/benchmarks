This repository contains benchmark codes used for performance analysis of ANNarchy. We also provide some model re-implementations in other neural simulators for performance comparisons. Each subfolder contains a specific benchmark model, which we will describe in the following.

# COBA

A benchmark using leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and conductance-based synapses without synaptic plasticity. The model was originally proposed by Vogels et al. (2005). 

# Brunel

A benchmark using plasticity rules.
